---

Hi! I am Wentao Zhang, currently a Research Associate at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Bo An](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/). Prior to this, I worked as a Research Engineer at [Skywork AI 2050 Research](https://github.com/SkyworkAI) (Nov 2024 -- Feb 2026), focusing on LLM-powered multi-agent systems. Before that, I also served as a Research Associate with Prof. Bo An at NTU (Nov 2022 -- Nov 2024). I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from Nanjing University and my Bachelor's degree from Tianjin University of Finance and Economics.

My research primarily focuses on **LLM-powered autonomous agents** and **Financial AI (AI4Finance)**. I have worked on building hierarchical multi-agent frameworks for complex, long-horizon tasks such as web navigation, data analysis, and general computer control. I am also passionate about applying AI techniques -- including deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language models -- to financial applications such as algorithmic trading, portfolio management, and end-to-end FinTech platforms.

Research keywords include: **LLM Agents**, **Multi-Agent Systems**, **AI4Finance**, **Reinforcement Learning**, **Quantitative Trading**.
