# About Me

I am **Wentao Zhang**, currently a Research Engineer at **Skywork AI 2050 Research** in Singapore. Prior to this, I worked as a Research Associate at **Nanyang Technological University** (Nov 2022 -- Nov 2024) and as an Algorithm Engineer at **China Life Insurance Co., Ltd** (Aug 2020 -- Oct 2022).

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **large language models (LLMs)**, **multi-agent systems**, **FinTech**, **quantitative trading**, **reinforcement learning**, and **deep learning**. I am particularly interested in:

- **LLM-powered autonomous agents** -- designing hierarchical multi-agent frameworks for complex, long-horizon tasks (e.g., web navigation, data analysis, general computer control).
- **Financial AI** -- building end-to-end platforms and intelligent agents for forecasting, trading, and portfolio management with multimodal data integration.
- **Reinforcement learning** -- applying RL techniques to real-world decision-making problems such as high-frequency trading and portfolio optimization.

## Education

- **M.S. in Computer Science and Technology**, Nanjing University, China (Sep 2017 -- Jun 2020)
- **B.S. in Computer Science and Technology**, Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, China (Sep 2013 -- Jun 2017)
